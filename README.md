# The Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall problem is a famous game show problem named after the original host, Monty Hall.

Let's suppose that there are three doors. Behind one of these doors is something valuable. Behind the other two doors are nothing
or something undesirable. You get the initial pick of what door you want to open. After you have chosen your door, one of the doors
that contains nothing is revealed to you. Now you have the option to change to the other door or stay with the one you initially chose.

Is it to your advantage to change your pick to the other door?
